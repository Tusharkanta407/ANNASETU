# Text Visibility Fixes - AnnaSetu Website

## Issues Fixed

The hero section text and various other text elements throughout the website were not showing up properly due to insufficient color contrast.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Color Scheme** (`app/globals.css`)
   - Changed base colors to provide better contrast
   - Updated `--foreground` from `30 15% 15%` to `20 14.3% 4.1%` (darker, more visible)
   - Updated `--background` from `35 25% 97%` to `0 0% 100%` (pure white)
   - Improved muted-foreground contrast from `30 10% 40%` to `25 5.3% 44.7%`

### 2. **Added Explicit Font Families** (`app/globals.css`)
   - Added font-family to body element with fallbacks
   - Added font-family to all heading elements (h1-h6)
   - Ensured Google Fonts are properly loaded with system font fallbacks

### 3. **Enhanced Text Color Classes** (`app/page.tsx`)
   - Hero heading: Added `text-foreground` class
   - Hero description: Changed from `text-muted-foreground` to `text-foreground/80`
   - Stats labels: Changed from `text-muted-foreground` to `text-foreground/70`
   - Section headings: Added explicit `text-foreground` class
   - Section descriptions: Changed to `text-foreground/70` for better visibility
   - Step descriptions: Updated to `text-foreground/70`

### 4. **Typography Improvements**
   ```css
   body {
     font-family: var(--font-dm-sans), system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
   }
   
   h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
     font-family: var(--font-poppins), system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
     color: hsl(var(--foreground));
   }
   ```

## Color Palette Used

### Light Mode (Default)
- **Background**: Pure white (`hsl(0 0% 100%)`)
- **Foreground**: Dark gray (`hsl(20 14.3% 4.1%)`)
- **Primary**: Earthy brown (`hsl(35 45% 35%)`)
- **Secondary**: Olive green (`hsl(82 35% 45%)`)
- **Accent**: Gold (`hsl(42 85% 55%)`)

### Dark Mode
- **Background**: Very dark brown (`hsl(20 14.3% 4.1%)`)
- **Foreground**: Off-white (`hsl(0 0% 95%)`)
- Adjusted colors maintain proper contrast in dark mode

## Testing

All pages have been tested and text is now visible with proper contrast:
- ✅ Home page (Hero, Features, How It Works, Beneficiaries, Testimonials, CTA)
- ✅ About page
- ✅ Marketplace page
- ✅ Farmers page
- ✅ Buyers page
- ✅ Traceability page
- ✅ Schemes page
- ✅ Contact page
- ✅ Auth pages (Login/Signup)

## Accessibility

The new color scheme provides:
- WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for body text)
- Enhanced readability across all devices
- Better visibility in both light and dark modes
- Consistent typography hierarchy

## Next Steps

The website is now fully functional with all text properly visible. You can:
1. View it at `http://localhost:3002`
2. Toggle between light/dark modes to verify contrast
3. Test on different devices for responsive design
4. Customize colors further if needed in `app/globals.css`
